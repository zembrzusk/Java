# Java
More interesting(in my opinion) projects written in Java I've created during my studies at Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology and my free time.

GUI - 2nd semester class with three main projects: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; simple ballons animation (suiting specific requirements), <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; calculator with the ability to show mathematic function graph, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; guess a word game.

Optician Office Project: <br>
An application in Java (also frontend) for small optician offices. The app supports opticians as well as other employees - salespeople or doctors during the process - starting from creating a prescription, order and glasses up to collection by the client. The system was created for the last semester class of Modeling of Computer System. It includes all sorts of examples of classes, attributes, associations, inheritance and constraints.
