# Java
More interesting(in my opinion) projects written in Java I've created during my studies at Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology and my free time.

GUI - 2nd semester class with three main projects:
  simple ballons application (suiting specific requirements),
  calculator with the ability to show mathematic function graph,
  guess a word game.
