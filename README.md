# Java
More interesting(in my opinion) projects written in Java I've created during my studies at Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology and my free time.

GUI - 2nd semester class with three main projects: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; simple ballons animation (suiting specific requirements), <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; calculator with the ability to show mathematic function graph, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; guess a word game.
